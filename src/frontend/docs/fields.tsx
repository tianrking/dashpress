      <p>
        You will be to make field-level customizations on the tables, details, create form
        and edit form. We have three tabs here so lets start with the first.
      </p>
      <h4> Labels</h4>
      <p>
        This tab enables you to rename the label of the field. Say you want to
        <code> name</code> to be called <code>Full Name</code> or{" "}
        <code>updatedAt</code> to be called <code>Last Updated</code> then you
        simplly input the desired name under the field and submit and the column
        will be renamed everywhere.
      </p>
      <h4> Types</h4>
      <p>
        Two quick notes as we head in to this section
        <ol>
          <li>
            Hadmean is not a database client meaning any action taken here will not reflect on your database.
          </li>
          <li>
            We strongly advise that you edit your schema to minimize you touching this section.
          </li>
        </ol>
      </p>
      <p>Having said that, there are three things you can do in this section</p>
      <h5>1. Choosing More Specific Data Type</h5>
      <p>
        Here you can be more specific about the type of your field, You can choose
        more appropriate field type like <code>email</code>,{" "}
        <code> url</code>, <code> color,</code>
        <code>image</code> over the plain <code>text</code> field type.
      </p>
      <p>
        You will see that some field types are disabled and these are for
        fields like <code>boolean</code>, <code>date</code>, <code>enum</code>{" "}
        etc. which really don&apos;t have sister types so there is nothing you
        can update it to
      </p>
      <p>
        You will also see that the selections are narrowed as you will not see a
        <code> email</code> selection for a numerical field nor will you see{" "}
        <code>number</code> for
        <code> text</code> field. This is to eliminate the possibility an invalid selection.
      </p>
      <h5>2. Managing Validations</h5>
      <p>
        Hadmean, will try to pick all the database validations that it can, so it knows the
        <code> non-nullable</code> constraint means the field is <code>required</code> and so on.

        We also translate other constraints to validations like <code>maxLength</code>,{" "}
        <code>isDate</code>, <code>unique</code>,<code> isBoolean</code> etc.
      </p>
      <p>
        Note that validations picked from database can&apos;t be removed on the app.
        The only way to remove them is to remove them from database and restart your app.
      </p>
      <p>
        The <code> Configure Validation</code> button allows you to add more validations that we can&apos;t possibly
        get from the database like{" "}
        <code>minLength</code>,<code> regex</code>, <code>alphanumeric</code>,{" "}
        <code>matchOtherField</code> etc.
        We also provide a text input for you to customize the validation message.
      </p>
      <h5> 3. Configure Selection</h5>
      <p>
        When the field is an enum field or you select <code>selection</code> as the type. You will
        see a <code>Configure Selections</code> button which will allow you select
        colors for enum field types and manage the selections for the <code>selection</code> type.
      </p>
      <h4> Order</h4>
      <p>
        Here you will be able to order the fields around and the order will also be
        reflected on tables, details view and forms
      </p>
